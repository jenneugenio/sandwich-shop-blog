      <h1>Sandwich Shop Blog</h1>
      <p>This blog is about rating different sandwich shops in the Seattle area.
        I will be rating them on taste, cleanliness, customer service.

      <h2>Jimmy Johns</h2>
      <img src="img/jimmy-johns.jpg" alt="Picture of Jimmy John's sandwich">
      <p>Jimmy John's is known to be <span class="slogan">freaky fast</span> and they truly are! You can order and they'll have your sandwich ready when you arrive. Though fast, the taste is ok. The stores are always very clean and you'll always see employees cleaning and sweeping floors.</p>

      <h2>Potbelly</h2>
      <img src="img/potbelly.jpg" alt="Picture of Potbelly sandwich">
      <p>The taste is amazing! Potbelly could use a little love in the cleanliness department; however, the staff is always friendly and always puts a smile on a customer's face after ordering a <span class="slogan">toasty sammie.</span></p>

      <h2>Subway</h2>
      <img src="img/subway.jpg" alt="Picture of Subway sandwich">
      <p><span class="slogan">Eat fresh</span>...maybe? Subway is great for quick service and the place is clean but the food disappoints.</p>

      <p>I <em>love</em> sandwiches! Any type of bread, meat, cheese, or exotic toppings so I am definitely not biased!
        I have been a food critic for ten years but sandwiches are my favorite to judge. My parents used to say I was born with a sandwich in hand.
